# Image-Quantization

FCIS Algorithms Project

### 1- Construct the graph:

i-Find Distinct Colors

ii-Construct The Graph

### 2- Find Minimal Spanning Tree

### 3- Extract the K clusters from the minimum spanning tree

### 4- Find the representative color of each cluster

### 5- Quantize the image by replacing the colors of each cluster by its representative color
